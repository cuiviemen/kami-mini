# kami-mini
A extruder using LGX gears

Heavily inspired by the [Sherpa Mini](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder) by [Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/)

Same attachment spacing and filament path as the Sherpa Mini.

4 heat inserts are used, based using the smaller size heat insets. 

3 M3x25 screws used to hold it together.
