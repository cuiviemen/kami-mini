A extruder using LGX gears

Heavily inspired by the [Sherpa Mini](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder) by [Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/)

Same attachment spacing and filament path as the Sherpa Mini.

4 heat inserts are used, based using the smaller size heat insets. 
(**Note:** _One of the heat insets has only 2/3 of plastic around it, after installing inset, you might need to trim the plastic down to ensure that it is not interferring with the gear._)

3 M3x25 screws used to hold it together.
